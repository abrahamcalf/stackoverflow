To create a website using [GitHub pages][1] you need to create an `index.html` file into any repository (No matter what name your repository is).

Then you need to **publish** your repository to be able to have your website.

1. First, go to your repository
1. Then go to `Settings` tab
1. Scroll down until you reach **GitHub Pages**
1. Then in source, you need to select your `branch`, in your case `master branch`

1. Then click on save and you are ready to go!!

Your repository will be online at `http://username.github.io/yourRepoName`

If your repository name is `username.github.io` your website will be live at `http://username.github.io`

Also, you need to know that you can only public static websites.
