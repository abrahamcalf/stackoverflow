Dude, your problem is that you created a repository with just your username so it will be live at `https://USERNAME.github.io/USERNAME`, to make it appear on your root domain you need to create a new repository or rename it to  `username.github.io` in your case `vadzvnik.github.io` that will make your website be at `https://vadzvnik.github.io`. Hope I helped you.
