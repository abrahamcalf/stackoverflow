It is pretty cool to have **Github** as a content management, but **Github** but your information matters, there are things that cannot be open source: so you must pay for it.

Github offers different plans for private repositories, the cheapest is **$7** per Month as 2018.

See [github.com/pricing][2]

I currently have that plan and what I do to work as a team is create a private repository and for it into our team Organization, and then we have private repositories.
