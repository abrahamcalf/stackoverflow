There is also [**`tocamelcase`**](https://github.com/abranhe/tocamelcase/) to easily convert from snake case to camel case.

## Install

`$ pip install tocamelcase`

and then you can use it like this:

    import tocamelcase

    print(tocamelcase.convert("non_camel_case"))
    # -> non_camel_case â†’ NonCamelCase

There is also [**`decamelize`**](https://github.com/abranhe/decamelize) that is the inverse of this module.
